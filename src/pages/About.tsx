              I’m a recent graduate and an aspiring full-stack developer with a
              strong interest in building creative, functional, and
              user-friendly digital experiences. I have hands-on experience with
              frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as
              well as backend skills in Python and MySQL.
            </span>
            <span>
              During my academic journey, I’ve developed projects such as a
              Student Management System and an AI-powered Energy Management
              System, which helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and
              understand the complete development process.
            </span>
            <span>
              I’m eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges in the tech
              world, with the goal of becoming a well-rounded developer who can
              handle both the visual and functional aspects of web applications.
